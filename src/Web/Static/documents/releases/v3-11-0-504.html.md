* SeanHall: WIXBUG:5238 - Get the engine's file handle as soon as possible.  Also, when launching Burn processes, pass a file handle of the exe to the process on the command line.
* SeanHall: WIXBUG:5234 - Make Burn grab a file handle to the original bundle so it can still access compressed payloads even if the original bundle was deleted after initialization (e.g. when a bundle uses Burn's built-in update mechanism). Also, when launching the clean room Burn process, pass a file handle of the original exe to the process on the command line. Use this file handle when using the attached container.
