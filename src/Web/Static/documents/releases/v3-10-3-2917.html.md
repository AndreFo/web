* FRichter: WIXBUG:5277 - burn engine: Always use the bundle source path for all purposes. The original source path is needed in all cases: for copying the bundle to the layout directory as well as for checking whether we're layouting to the bundle location.
* RobMen: WIXBUG:5282 - reduce clean room security to successfully load BA's dependent on GDI+ (including WinForms).
* @barnson: Fix bad merge of v3.11 references into v3.10.3.
