* SeanHall: WIXBUG:5238 - Get the engine's file handle as soon as possible.  Also, when launching Burn processes, pass a file handle of the exe to the process on the command line.
* SeanHall: WIXBUG:5234 - Make Burn grab a file handle to the original bundle so it can still access compressed payloads even if the original bundle was deleted after initialization (e.g. when a bundle uses Burn's built-in update mechanism). Also, when launching the clean room Burn process, pass a file handle of the original exe to the process on the command line. Use this file handle when using the attached container.
* jchoover: WIXBUG:5193 - Fix /layout default directory with clean room:
  * Attempt to use WixBundleSourceProcessPath / WixBundleSourceProcessFolder before defaulting to PathForCurrentProcess
  * Prevent trying to layout the origional bundle exe on top of the existing exe, if the path provided to layout is the same as the bundles working directory.
